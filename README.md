# PyWRBS
A free text-based wrestling event booking simulator.
PyWRBS stands for Python Wrestling Booking Simulator.
It is recommended to use the pylaunch.py script to start the sim.
This was written with Python 3 and imports the random module.
It is best used on Linux or with WSL.
# C# Version
There is also a version included called CSWRBS that is written in C#. It requires the Mono C# compiler to be installed to run from the launcher script.
 the following command installs Mono on Ubuntu: "sudo apt install mono-devel".<br><b>I only made this version to familiarize myself with C# language syntax, so it may stop being regularly updated in favor of PyWRBS.</b>
